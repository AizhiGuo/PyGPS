# PyGPS
## Extracing displacement and atmospheric parameters from GPS products for improving InSAR geodesy.
#### GPS products from [Nevada Geodetic Laboratory](http://geodesy.unr.edu/) and [UNAVCO](https://www.unavco.org/) are supported.    

+ Search available GPS stations over an interested region
+ Download the GPS products of interest
+ Extract the spatio-temporal displacement and atmospheric products (time series or near SAR acquisition epoch)
+ Mitigating the atmospheric effects for InSAR geodesy
+ Generate high-resolution atmospheric water vapor map by fusing InSAR and GPS measurement
